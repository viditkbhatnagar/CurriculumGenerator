# Render Deployment Guide

This guide walks you through deploying the Curriculum Generator App to Render using the provided `render.yaml` blueprint.

## Prerequisites

Before deploying to Render, ensure you have:

1. **GitHub Repository** - Code pushed to a GitHub repository
2. **Render Account** - Sign up at [render.com](https://render.com)
3. **MongoDB Atlas Cluster** - M10 or higher tier with vector search enabled
4. **OpenAI API Key** - From [platform.openai.com](https://platform.openai.com)
5. **Auth0 Account** - For authentication (optional but recommended)
6. **Sentry Account** - For error tracking (optional but recommended)

## Deployment Steps

### Step 1: Prepare MongoDB Atlas

1. **Create MongoDB Atlas Cluster**
   - Log in to [MongoDB Atlas](https://cloud.mongodb.com)
   - Create a new cluster (M10 or higher for vector search)
   - Choose the same region as your Render services (e.g., Oregon)

2. **Configure Network Access**
   - Go to Network Access in Atlas
   - Click "Add IP Address"
   - Select "Allow Access from Anywhere" (0.0.0.0/0)
   - Note: Render uses dynamic IPs, so you need to allow all IPs

3. **Create Database User**
   - Go to Database Access
   - Create a new user with read/write permissions
   - Save the username and password securely

4. **Get Connection String**
   - Click "Connect" on your cluster
   - Choose "Connect your application"
   - Copy the connection string
   - Replace `<password>` with your database user password
   - Replace `<dbname>` with `curriculum_db`

5. **Create Vector Search Index**
   - Go to Atlas Search
   - Create a new search index on the `knowledgeBase` collection
   - Use the following configuration:
   ```json
   {
     "mappings": {
       "dynamic": false,
       "fields": {
         "embedding": {
           "type": "knnVector",
           "dimensions": 1536,
           "similarity": "cosine"
         },
         "domain": {
           "type": "string"
         },
         "credibilityScore": {
           "type": "number"
         },
         "publicationDate": {
           "type": "date"
         }
       }
     }
   }
   ```

### Step 2: Deploy to Render Using Blueprint

1. **Connect GitHub Repository**
   - Log in to Render
   - Click "New" â†’ "Blueprint"
   - Connect your GitHub account if not already connected
   - Select your repository

2. **Configure Blueprint**
   - Render will detect the `render.yaml` file
   - Review the services that will be created:
     - `curriculum-frontend` - Next.js web service
     - `curriculum-api` - Express API web service
     - `curriculum-worker` - Background worker
     - `curriculum-redis` - Redis database

3. **Set Environment Variables**
   
   Before deploying, you need to set the following environment variables that are marked as `sync: false` in the blueprint:

   **For curriculum-frontend:**
   - `NEXT_PUBLIC_AUTH0_DOMAIN` - Your Auth0 domain (e.g., `your-domain.auth0.com`)
   - `NEXT_PUBLIC_AUTH0_CLIENT_ID` - Your Auth0 client ID

   **For curriculum-api:**
   - `MONGODB_URI` - Your MongoDB Atlas connection string
   - `OPENAI_API_KEY` - Your OpenAI API key
   - `AUTH0_DOMAIN` - Your Auth0 domain
   - `AUTH0_AUDIENCE` - Your Auth0 API audience
   - `SENTRY_DSN` - Your Sentry DSN (optional)

   **For curriculum-worker:**
   - `MONGODB_URI` - Same as API
   - `OPENAI_API_KEY` - Same as API
   - `ENCRYPTION_KEY` - Will be auto-generated, but copy from API service
   - `SENTRY_DSN` - Same as API (optional)

4. **Deploy Blueprint**
   - Click "Apply" to create all services
   - Render will start building and deploying all services
   - This may take 5-10 minutes for the initial deployment

### Step 3: Verify Deployment

1. **Check Service Status**
   - Go to the Render dashboard
   - Verify all services show "Live" status
   - Check the logs for any errors

2. **Test Health Endpoints**
   ```bash
   # Test API health
   curl https://curriculum-api.onrender.com/health
   
   # Should return:
   # {
   #   "status": "healthy",
   #   "services": {
   #     "database": { "status": "healthy" },
   #     "cache": { "status": "healthy" }
   #   }
   # }
   ```

3. **Test Frontend**
   - Open the frontend URL in your browser
   - Verify the application loads correctly
   - Test authentication if configured

4. **Test API Endpoints**
   ```bash
   # Test API root
   curl https://curriculum-api.onrender.com/api
   
   # Should return:
   # { "message": "Curriculum Generator API" }
   ```

### Step 4: Configure Auto-Deploy

Auto-deploy is already enabled in the blueprint. Any push to the `main` branch will trigger automatic deployments.

To deploy from a different branch:
1. Go to each service settings
2. Update the "Branch" field
3. Save changes

### Step 5: Configure Persistent Disk

The persistent disk for file uploads is automatically configured in the blueprint:
- Mount path: `/app/uploads`
- Size: 10GB
- Attached to: `curriculum-api` service

To increase disk size:
1. Go to the `curriculum-api` service
2. Click on "Disks" tab
3. Adjust the size as needed
4. Save changes

- Worker: Standard ($25/month)
- Redis: Standard ($25/month)
- **Total: ~$160/month**

### Scaling Considerations

1. **API Service**
   - Start with Standard plan
   - Scale to Pro if handling >100 concurrent users
   - Enable auto-scaling for traffic spikes

2. **Worker Service**
   - Start with Starter plan
   - Scale to Standard if processing >10 jobs concurrently
   - Add multiple worker instances for high load

3. **Redis**
   - Starter plan sufficient for most use cases
   - Upgrade to Standard if cache hit rate drops
   - Monitor memory usage in Render dashboard

4. **Persistent Disk**
   - Start with 10GB
   - Monitor usage in Render dashboard
   - Increase as needed (charged per GB)

## Monitoring and Logs

### Accessing Logs

1. **Service Logs**
   - Go to service in Render dashboard
   - Click "Logs" tab
   - View real-time logs
   - Filter by log level

2. **Health Checks**
   - Render automatically monitors health endpoints
   - View health check history in service dashboard
   - Configure alerts for health check failures

3. **Metrics**
   - View CPU and memory usage in dashboard
   - Monitor request rates and response times
   - Set up alerts for resource thresholds

### Sentry Integration

If Sentry is configured:
1. Errors are automatically captured
2. View errors in Sentry dashboard
3. Set up alerts for error spikes
4. Track error trends over time

## Troubleshooting

### Service Won't Start

**Symptoms:** Service shows "Deploy failed" or keeps restarting

**Solutions:**
1. Check build logs for compilation errors
2. Verify all required environment variables are set
3. Check MongoDB connection string is correct
4. Verify MongoDB Atlas network access allows Render IPs

### Health Check Failing

**Symptoms:** Service shows "Unhealthy" status

**Solutions:**
1. Check service logs for errors
2. Verify MongoDB connection: `curl https://your-api.onrender.com/health`
3. Check Redis connection status
4. Verify environment variables are correct

### Worker Not Processing Jobs

**Symptoms:** Jobs stuck in queue, not being processed

**Solutions:**
1. Check worker logs for errors
2. Verify Redis connection
3. Verify MongoDB connection
4. Check worker service is running (not sleeping)
5. Verify Bull queue configuration

### File Uploads Failing

**Symptoms:** File upload returns error or files disappear

**Solutions:**
1. Verify persistent disk is attached to API service
2. Check disk usage (may be full)
3. Verify upload directory permissions
4. Check file size limits (max 50MB)

### Slow Performance

**Symptoms:** API responses are slow, timeouts

**Solutions:**
1. Check MongoDB Atlas performance metrics
2. Verify indexes are created (run migration)
3. Scale up service plan
4. Enable Redis caching
5. Check for slow queries in logs

## Database Migrations

Migrations run automatically during deployment as part of the build command:
```bash
npm run build && npm run migrate:up
```

To run migrations manually:
1. Go to API service in Render
2. Click "Shell" tab
3. Run: `npm run migrate:up`

To check migration status:
```bash
npm run migrate:status
```

## Rollback Procedure

If a deployment fails or causes issues:

1. **Rollback via Render Dashboard**
   - Go to service in Render
   - Click "Deploys" tab
   - Find previous successful deploy
   - Click "Rollback to this deploy"

2. **Rollback via Git**
   - Revert the commit: `git revert <commit-hash>`
   - Push to main branch
   - Render will auto-deploy the reverted version

3. **Rollback Database Migration**
   ```bash
   # In Render shell
   npm run migrate:down
   ```

## Security Best Practices

1. **Environment Variables**
   - Never commit secrets to Git
   - Use Render's environment variable management
   - Rotate secrets regularly

2. **Network Security**
   - MongoDB Atlas: Use IP whitelist (0.0.0.0/0 for Render)
   - Enable HTTPS (automatic on Render)
   - Configure CORS properly

3. **Access Control**
   - Limit team access to production services
   - Use separate environments for dev/staging/prod
   - Enable audit logging in Render

4. **Monitoring**
   - Set up Sentry for error tracking
   - Monitor health endpoints
   - Set up alerts for critical issues

## Cost Optimization

1. **Use Starter Plans for Development**
   - Downgrade non-production services
   - Use free tier for testing

2. **Optimize Worker Usage**
   - Scale down during low-traffic periods
   - Use cron jobs instead of always-on workers if possible

3. **Monitor Resource Usage**
   - Check CPU and memory usage regularly
   - Downgrade if consistently under-utilized
   - Upgrade only when needed

4. **Optimize Database Queries**
   - Use indexes effectively
   - Implement caching
   - Reduce unnecessary queries
