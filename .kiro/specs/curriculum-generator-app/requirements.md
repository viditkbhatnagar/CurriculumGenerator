# Requirements Document

## Introduction

The Curriculum Generator App is an AI-powered system for AGCQ that automates the creation of professional certification preparation courses. The system intakes Subject Matter Expert (SME) submissions via Excel templates, processes content through Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG), and outputs complete program specifications, unit specifications, and learning materials. The application enforces academic standards, validates sources, and benchmarks against competitor institutions to ensure quality and compliance.
