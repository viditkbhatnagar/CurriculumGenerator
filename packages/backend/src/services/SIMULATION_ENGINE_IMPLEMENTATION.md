# Simulation Engine Implementation Summary

## Task 14.1: Create Scenario Generation System

### Implementation Status: ✅ COMPLETE

This document summarizes the implementation of the scenario generation system for the Simulation Engine, which creates realistic workplace scenarios for interactive learning.

## Requirements Coverage

### Requirement 9.1: Generate realistic workplace scenarios
**Status:** ✅ Implemented

The system generates scenarios based on:
- **Topic**: Subject matter for the scenario
- **Difficulty**: 1-5 scale determining complexity
- **Industry**: Optional industry context
- **Role Type**: Optional role specification

### Requirement 9.2: Implement decision tree structure for branching paths
**Status:** ✅ Implemented

The system supports branching paths through:
- Dynamic state generation based on student actions
- Multiple action options at each step
- Consequences that affect subsequent scenario states
- `generateNextState()` method creates branching based on choices

## Key Features Implemented

### 1. Scenario Templates
- Pre-built templates for common topics (e.g., "business-communication")
- Template structure includes:
  - Context templates with variable substitution
  - Situation templates for different difficulty levels
  - Action templates with optimal/non-optimal classifications

### 2. LLM-Based Custom Scenario Generation
- For topics without templates, uses LLM to generate:
  - Realistic workplace context
  - Challenging situations
  - Multiple action options with categories
  - Learning objectives
  - Best practices

### 3. Action Categories
All actions are categorized into:
- **Analysis**: Examining and understanding the situation
- **Communication**: Interacting with stakeholders
- **Decision**: Making choices and commitments
- **Implementation**: Taking concrete actions

### 4. Scenario Structure
Each scenario includes:
```typescript
{
  scenarioId: string;
  title: string;
  context: string;
  topic: string;
  difficulty: number;
  initialState: ScenarioState;
  learningObjectives: string[];
  bestPractices: string[];
  metadata: {
    industry?: string;
    roleType?: string;
    estimatedDuration?: number;
  };
}
```

### 5. Initial State Structure
```typescript
{
  currentSituation: string;
  availableActions: Action[];
  previousActions: StudentAction[];
  feedback: string;
  score: number;
  isComplete: boolean;
  currentStep: number;
  totalSteps: number;
}
```

### 6. Database Storage
- Scenarios stored in `simulations` table
- Includes all scenario data and metadata
- Linked to optional course IDs

## API Endpoints

  }
}
```

## Testing

Comprehensive test suite covers:
- ✅ Template-based scenario generation
- ✅ Proper initial state structure
- ✅ Multiple action categories
- ✅ Difficulty scaling (more steps for harder scenarios)
- ✅ Metadata inclusion

All tests passing (5/5).

## Technical Implementation Details

### Template System
The `initializeTemplates()` method sets up pre-configured templates for common topics. This provides:
- Faster generation for common scenarios
- Consistent quality for frequently used topics
- Fallback to LLM generation for custom topics

### LLM Integration
For custom scenarios, the system:
1. Constructs detailed prompts with context
2. Uses structured output (JSON mode) for reliable parsing
3. Includes error handling with fallback options
4. Generates learning objectives and best practices

### Difficulty Scaling
Difficulty affects:
- Total number of steps (3 + difficulty)
- Complexity of situations
- Number of available actions (4-6)
- Estimated duration (10 + difficulty * 5 minutes)

### Action Generation
Actions are balanced to include:
- ~60% optimal actions (good choices)
- ~40% non-optimal actions (learning opportunities)
- Mix of all four categories
- Clear descriptions for student understanding

## Integration Points

### Database
- PostgreSQL for scenario storage
- JSONB fields for flexible state storage
- Indexes for efficient querying

### LLM Service
- Uses existing `llmService` for content generation
- Structured output for reliable JSON parsing
- Error handling with fallbacks

### Authentication
- All endpoints protected with `authenticateToken` middleware
- Student ID extracted from JWT token

## Next Steps (Task 14.2)

The following features are ready for implementation in task 14.2:
- Process student actions and update scenario state
- Track student choices throughout simulation
- Evaluate performance against best practices
- Generate detailed feedback with scores
- Allow scenario replay

These features are partially implemented but need completion and testing.
