## Performance Impact

The monitoring implementation has minimal performance impact:
- Logging: Asynchronous, non-blocking
- Metrics: In-memory with periodic flushing
- Error tracking: Asynchronous with sampling
- Health checks: On-demand, not in request path
- Alerting: Background process, 1-minute intervals

## Conclusion

- Provides full visibility into system operations
- Tracks critical business metrics
- Enables proactive issue detection
- Supports debugging and troubleshooting
- Meets all requirements for production deployment
- Follows industry best practices
- Is fully documented and ready for use

The implementation is production-ready and can be deployed immediately with optional CloudWatch and Sentry integrations.
